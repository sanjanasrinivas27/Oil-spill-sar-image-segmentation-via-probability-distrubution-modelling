# Oil-spill-sar-image-segmentation-via-probability-distrubution-modelling
This project explores segmentation of oil spill regions in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using probability distribution–based modeling. It involves basic preprocessing, statistical analysis of pixel intensities, and visualization of segmented regions using Python.
